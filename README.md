# Flock of Features Tracking

A variation of the
[Flock of Features](http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/pubs/KolschRTVHCI2004.pdf)
algorithm which weights features by the amount of time they've been tracked.
Idea was hatched after listening to (terrible) high school jazz ensemble that
was saved by the few players that managed to stay with the conductor.  Results
were marginally improved.

A video demonstration of the tracking is available
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFAgsNZqjoQ).

The original motivation for this code was embedding into an application I was
developing.
